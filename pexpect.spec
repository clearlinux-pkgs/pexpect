%description
The best way to run these tests is from the directory above this one. Source
the test.env environment file. This will make sure that you are using the
correct pexpect.py file otherwise Python might try to import a different
version if it is already installed in this environment. Then run the testall.py
script in the tools/ directory. This script will automatically build a test
suite from all the test scripts in the tests/ directory. This allows you to add
new test scripts simply by dropping them in the tests/ directory. You don't
have to register the test or do anything else to integrate it into the test
suite.
